Round two in my experiments with bone carving is a [Hei matau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hei_matau) - a stylised fish hook from Māori legend. I still have quite a bit of finishing to do, but the general shape is complete!

The bone I used (part of a femur) to create this piece is much more suitable to carving than the [rib bone](/posts/2015-03-08-bone-carving-experiment-one.html) I had previously used in for the beard comb. It is extremely strong!

The next steps are to finish off the edging and polish!
