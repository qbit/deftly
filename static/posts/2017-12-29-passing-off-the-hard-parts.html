<h1>The Password Dilemma</h1>

<p>For quite some time I was a user of KeePass. Life was great I had a
client that worked on every platform (OpenBSD via <code>mono</code>, Android and
iOS via 3rd party apps). Every now and then I would manually copy the
file from my &ldquo;main&rdquo; machine to all the others.</p>

<p>After a while the syncing process became tedious. I attempted to find
things that would aid in the process.. Tools like <code>syncthing</code>,
<code>unison</code>, dropbox.. etc. They all had issues. With <code>syncthing</code> the
synchronizing was unreliable. Most of the time it couldn&rsquo;t find other
hosts on my network.. and when it finally did I would end up needing
to tell it how to resolve conflicts. Dropbox didn&rsquo;t have a native
client for OpenBSD - not to mention putting your password database
online is a terrifying proposition (my main issue with LastPass)!</p>

<p>Out of all the management methods I tried - LastPass was the most
&ldquo;complete&rdquo;:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Syncing</th>
<th>Browser</th>
<th>OpenBSD</th>
<th>iOS/Android</th>

<h1>Enter pass</h1>

<p><code>pass</code> is touted as &ldquo;the standard Unix password manager&rdquo;. It works
by keeping your passwords in individual PGP encrypted files. For
example, the entry <code>Web/google.com</code> would hold my &ldquo;google.com&rdquo;
password. An entry can contain more than just your passwords (I
have <code>username: ....</code> set on the 2nd line.), the first line
is always expected to be the password.</p>

<p>Out of the box, pass supports syncing via git, multiple recipients
(meaning it can encrypt a password file for multiple people),
random password generation and copying to clipboard with
auto-clear!</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t, however, work out of the box on iOS/Android or my
browser. Fortunately for me - pass has a fantastic ecosystem
with a multitude of 3rd party browser extensions, iOS/Android apps.. best
all, they are open source! There are even full replacements for
pass itself! One such replacements is <a href="https://github.com/justwatchcom/gopass">gopass</a>.</p>

<p><code>gopass</code> extends pass a bit further, it&rsquo;s written in Go,
seamlessly supports multiple &ldquo;stores&rdquo; (allowing me to have an
extra level of privledge separation for sensitive passwords),
is pledge()&rsquo;d, AND can run on every OS I use!</p>

<p>For browsers, I have settled on <a href="https://github.com/dannyvankooten/browserpass">browserpass</a>. It&rsquo;s also written
in Go, pledge()&rsquo;d, works on all my systems* (OpenBSD, Windows
macos), has auto-fill and easy to grok source code!</p>

<p>For iOS/Android there are <a href="https://github.com/mssun/passforios">passforios</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zeapo/Android-Password-Store">Android-Password-Store</a>. All of which support
syncing via git!</p>

<p>Couple all this together and I get:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Syncing</th>
<th>Browser</th>
<th>OpenBSD</th>
<th>iOS/Android</th>
<th>My Trust</th>

<h1>A few hurdles</h1>

<h2>Key management</h2>

<p>PGP key management was an initial hurdle for me. Having to copy keys
from one computer to another put me back in the same situation I had
with KeePass.. syncing.</p>

<p>My solution to this problem is to store my PGP keys on a SmartCard
(Yubikey 4 in this case). This lets me &ldquo;transfer&rdquo; my PGP key between my
main computers without issue. It also has the added advantage of
giving me an ssh key I can use on less trusted machines!</p>

<p>For me, the Yubikey is ideal because of the form factor, however,
there are other alternatives such as NitroKey.</p>

<h2>Remote access</h2>

<p>Because pass and friends sync by way of git, you must expose your git
repo to be able to use the sync mechanism. I didn&rsquo;t want to expose my
main repo to the world (even though it is only available via ssh), so
it is only accessible via my home network.</p>

<p>I have an ssh key per device, and use the <code>command=</code> option in
<code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> to force git-only ssh access to less trusted
devices.</p>

<p>For example, my phone is less trusted than my OpenBSD laptop, so I
have an entry like this:</p>

<pre><code>command=&quot;git-shell -c \&quot;$SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND\&quot;&quot;,no-port-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-pty ssh-rsa ........ dumbdevice
</code></pre>

<p>This limits the device <code>dumbdevice</code> to only executing <code>git-shell</code>!</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>All things considered, this setup takes a little bit to configure
initially (with keys and git repos.. etc), but its advantages
out weigh that hurdle for me:</p>

<ol>
<li>It&rsquo;s very simple. No databases, no extra exposed services.. etc.</li>
<li>It uses existing tools to manage / sync my passwords. I trust ssh way
more than I trust a web server!</li>
<li>The ecosystem is very active.</li>
<li>If need be, I can operate entirely without the &ldquo;pass&rdquo; tools via
something like:
<code>gpg -d ~/.password-store/Web/google.com | head -n1 | xclip</code></li>
</ol>

<p>* Currently there is a bug in Firefox on OpenBSD that prevents
native extensions from functioning.. I hope to get this fixed
soon! Chromium works fine, however.</p>
