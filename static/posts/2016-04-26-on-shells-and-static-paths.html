<p><strong><em>In a previous post, I told people not to start their scripts with
<code>#!/bin/bash</code>. In this post, I will explain in more detail why you
shouldn&rsquo;t do this if you want your script to be portable!</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Operating systems, they are neat, aren&rsquo;t they? So much diversity, so
many options! Don&rsquo;t like the shell that comes stock on your OS because
it doesn&rsquo;t connect to the internet, download a list of packages that
<em>might</em> be similar to a mistyped command you haphazardly pasted into
your terminal? Great, you can install one that does! So many options!</p>

<p>With all these options available to us, how can someone settle on a
single PATH to contain all this greatness? Why put <code>bash</code> in <code>/bin</code>?
Why not <code>/opt/fancy/oh-bash-my-face/bin</code>?</p>

<p>Well.. lets not get crazy here&hellip; That&rsquo;s clearly a terrible location
for <code>bash</code>, no way it&rsquo;s standard!</p>

<h1>Right!</h1>

<p>Lets talk about a specific set of standards, <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7990989775/index.html">The Single UNIXÂ®
Specification</a>
and <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/">POSIX IEEE Std 1003.1</a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that not all Unixie operating systems conform to these
standards, but all of them implement enough to solve the problem of a
given shell not being installed in <code>/bin</code>!</p>

<h1>The wisdom of The Grey Ones</h1>

<p>Long ago, the Great Grey Ones knew that not everyone would put things
in <code>/bin</code>. They also knew that for a script/binary to be usefull.. it
needed to be in your PATH environment variable! Because of this.. they
made statements like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Applications should note that the standard PATH to the shell cannot
be assumed to be either /bin/sh or /usr/bin/sh, and should be
determined by interrogation of the PATH returned by getconf PATH,
ensuring that the returned pathname is an absolute pathname and not a
shell built-in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both POSIX and SUS define this.</p>

<p>I know what you are thinking: &ldquo;Surely this applies only to <code>sh</code>, <code>bash</code>
is the new standard, <code>bash</code> is everywhere! Anything that doesn&rsquo;t have
<code>bash</code> is old and therefore not used! My <code>bash</code> is in <code>/bin/bash</code> -
yours <strong>MUST</strong> be as well!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>No!</h2>

<p>What if I told you, some systems like <a href="http://openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> and
<a href="http://freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a> do things a little differently. They have
a clear distinction between &ldquo;base&rdquo; applications and applications that
are installed via their respective <code>ports</code> systems.</p>

<p>For various reasons, things like <code>bash</code> and <code>zsh</code> are not included in
&ldquo;base&rdquo;. This means they will be installed outside of the typical &ldquo;/bin,
/usr/bin&rdquo; directory structure. Which means when you put lines like:
<code>#!/bin/bash</code> at the top of your script you are ensuring that your
script will not run on OpenBSD or FreeBSD (or any other system that has
<code>bash</code> installed somewhere else)!</p>

<h1>Back to The Grey Ones</h1>

<p>They planned for this! They gave us nifty tools that allow us to
invoke these these shells without knowing the explicit path for said
shell!</p>

<p>Tools like <code>/usr/bin/env</code> which:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>executes utility after modifying the environment as specified on the
command line.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simply calling <code>env</code> will spit out a list of all your currently set
variables! These vars get passed to <code>utility</code> when you execute
something like <code>env bash</code> (where <code>bash</code> is the utility).</p>

<p>This means if we have our scripts execute <code>#!/usr/bin/env bash</code> as the
first line of our script, the PATH variable will be set to something
that is more likely to contain <code>bash</code> than an explicit declaration
like <code>/bin/bash</code> which, as we learned, doesn&rsquo;t exist on some systems!</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be <strong><em>that guy</em></strong>. If your script is meant to run on a variety
of systems, follow the advice of The Grey Ones, use something like
<code>env</code> to make your scripts portable. I have yet to see a *NIX OS that
lacks <code>/usr/bin/env</code>. This includes things like True64.</p>
